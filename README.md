# 🏫 Field Trip Insurance — Aptos Move Smart Contract

## 🌟 Description
A lightweight, trust-minimized insurance pool for school field trips on the Aptos blockchain. Participants contribute premiums to a pool owned by the organizer, and an authorized trip leader executes claim payouts within predefined caps. The contract enforces:
- Authorization (only the trip leader can approve payouts)
- Safety limits (max payout per claim)
- Solvency checks (cannot pay more than collected premiums)

Transparent. Auditable. Instant.

## 🚀 Vision
Empower educators and organizers with a seamless, on-chain insurance experience:
- Replace paperwork-heavy claims with code-enforced rules
- Provide real-time transparency of balances and limits
- Enable fast, accountable reimbursements during trips
- Offer a reusable blueprint for event-based community insurance

---

## 🔭 Future Scope
- Multi-asset support (beyond AptosCoin)
- On-chain events for contributions and payouts (indexer-ready)
- Governance to update leader, caps, and pool status
- Refund policy for unused premiums after trip completion
- Role-based co-leaders and emergency controls
- Claim metadata and auditable claim registry
- Web dashboard (Next.js) for non-technical users
